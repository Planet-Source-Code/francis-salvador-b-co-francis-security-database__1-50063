This program is designed under VISUAL BASIC 6.0 and performs a security database using Access.
It uses the password utility of Microsoft Access that enables only the program to open it.
It is a tutorial on using database instructions under access, simple manipulations of string, using tab 
strips, using modules, using combo boxes, etc...It also allows you to add and delete a user if you are logged
in an "ADMINISTRATOR LEVEL."

To access log "username: francis", "password:jkl"

Hope this could help those programmers out there...
